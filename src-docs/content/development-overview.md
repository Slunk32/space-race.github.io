# Development Overview

## PRs & Issues on GitHub

All issues for mission control should be opened against [the "core" repository (mc-core)](https://github.com/space-race/mc-core) unless they belong to a specific extension.

PRs on `mc-core` should be opened against the `develop` (default) branch.

Issues are generally organized into Milestones. You can view [a nice layout of the milestones here](/mission-control/docs/milestones.html) on the documentation site.

## Setting up a Development Environment

To get started developing, check out our [Development Environment Setup Guide](/mission-control/docs/development-environment-setup.html).
